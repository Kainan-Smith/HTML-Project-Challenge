        <h1>All About Fighting Games</h1>
        <p>Fighting games are quite the divisive genre in gaming communities.  They are rather difficult to get into on your own, as they are rather unique when compared to other genres.  It's best to approach the genre with a friend, who can be either experienced with the genre, or as new as you are.</p>
       
        <p>While there were previously a couple primitive fighting games before, the first <em>real</em> fighting game was Street Fighter 2.  It was immediately a massive success in the arcade scene.  Every game wanted to be the new Street Fighter 2, Art of Fighting, Mortal Kombat, even Capcom, the creators themselves, tried to rekindle the fame that SF2 had with games like Red Earth, Darkstalkers, and Cyberbots.</p>


        <p>Over the years, many different subgenres of fighting game had surfaced.  Like games where you select 2 or 3 characters instead of just 1, also known as "Tag Fighters."  Games where speed and Air Movement are more prioritized than grounded, neutral based gameplay, commonly called "Anime Fighters."  Or games where instead of playing on a 2 dimensional plane with a high jump, you play on a 3 dimensional plane with a more grounded, realistic jump, called "3D Fighters."</p>
